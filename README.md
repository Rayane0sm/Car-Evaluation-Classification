# Car Evaluation Classification

This TP used the Car Evaluation Dataset to predict car acceptability classes (unacc, acc, good, vgood) based on categorical attributes such as buying price, maintenance cost, doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety. After data cleaning and encoding categorical features, a Random Forest Classifier was trained and tested. The project illustrated concepts of categorical encoding, feature importance, and ensemble learning, while achieving solid predictive accuracy
